# WEATHER DASHBOARD 

NOT your average weather app! Featuring a Search Engine, Weekly Forecast, Sun - Moonrise times, input city imagery and a map rendering itâ€™s location. Utilizing React, JSX, CSS, Bootstrap, Axios and multiple API integrations: Pexels / Openweather / Mapbox, this project is the most advanced I have created to date. It required more knowledge than I gained studying over the past year, pushing me to read a lot of documentation to solve complex errors on my own.
